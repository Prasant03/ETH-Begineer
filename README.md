Token Creation Solidity Project
Welcome to the repository for the Ethereum beginner module course offered by MetaCrafters.
In this repository, you will find the code for a basic Solidity project that focuses on creating a token.
The project covers the implementation of functions to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens, allowing the user or owner to manage the token supply.

Project Overview:
This project serves as a hands-on introduction to Solidity, a programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The primary components of this project include:

Token Contract: A Solidity smart contract that defines the behavior of the token, including minting and burning tokens.

Minting Function: A function in the smart contract that enables the creation of new tokens and adds them to the token supply.

Burning Function: Another function that allows tokens to be destroyed or burned, effectively reducing the token supply.
