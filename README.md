University Token (UNI) - README
This contract implements the University Token (UNI), an ERC-20 compatible token on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides basic functionalities to mint and burn tokens for specific addresses.
Token Creation Solidity Project
Welcome to the repository for the Ethereum beginner module course offered by MetaCrafters. In this repository, you will find the code for a basic Solidity project that focuses on creating a token. The project covers the implementation of functions to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens, allowing the user or owner to manage the token supply.

Project Overview
This project serves as a hands-on introduction to Solidity, a programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The primary components of this project include:

Token Contract: A Solidity smart contract that defines the behavior of the token, including minting and burning tokens.


Token Details:
Token Name: UNIVERSITY
Token Abbreviation: UNI
Total Supply: 0 (Increases with minting)
Functions:
mint: This function allows authorized addresses to mint new UNI tokens for a specified address, increasing the total supply.

burn: This function allows authorized addresses to burn (remove) UNI tokens from a specified address, decreasing the total supply.

License:
This contract is distributed under the MIT License, granting you the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the code.

Disclaimer:
Please exercise caution and properly manage access to the mint and burn functions. This contract is provided for educational purposes and has not been audited for security. Use it at your own risk
