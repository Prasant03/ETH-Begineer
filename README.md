# Prash Coin (PCK)
# Project Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Ethereum beginner module course offered by MetaCrafters. This project serves as a hands-on introduction to Solidity, a programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The primary components of this project include a Token Contract that defines the behavior of the PrashCoin (PCK).

# Description
This project serves as an educational introduction to Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes a Solidity smart contract that defines the behavior of the PCK token, allowing authorized addresses to mint new PCK tokens and burn existing ones, thus managing the token supply.




 # Token Details
## Token Name: PrashCoin
## Token Abbreviation: PCK
## Total Supply: 0 (Increases with minting)
 # Functions
Minting Tokens
The mint function allows authorized addresses to mint new PCK tokens for a specified address, increasing the total supply.

Burning Tokens
The burn function allows authorized addresses to burn (remove) PCK tokens from a specified address, decreasing the total supply.


# Getting Started
Installing

Executing Program
Follow these steps to run the program:

Open Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Paste the code from this repository into the Remix editor.

Compile the contract by selecting the Solidity compiler version from the left-hand sidebar and clicking the "Compile" button.

Deploy the contract by navigating to the "Compile and Run" tab and clicking "Deploy" under "PCK."

Interact with the contract by using the mint and burn functions to manage PCK tokens for specific addresses. You can check the total supply using the totalsupply variable.
