# University Token (UNI)
# Simple Overview
This project implements the University Token (UNI), an ERC-20 compatible token on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides essential functionalities for minting and burning tokens for specific addresses.

# Description
This project serves as an educational introduction to Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes a Solidity smart contract that defines the behavior of the UNI token, allowing authorized addresses to mint new UNI tokens and burn existing ones, thus managing the token supply.

# Getting Started
Installing
To use this project:
Executing Program
Follow these steps to run the program:

Open Remix (https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Paste the code from this repository into the Remix editor.

Compile the contract by selecting the Solidity compiler version from the left-hand sidebar and clicking the "Compile" button.

Deploy the contract by navigating to the "Compile and Run" tab and clicking "Deploy" under "UNI."

Interact with the contract by using the mint and burn functions to manage UNI tokens for specific addresses. You can check the total supply using the totalsupply variable.
